# Impact of demographic change on energy use in a developing country: an Input-Output approach

## Abstract

As populations in developing countries move from rural to urban areas, their consumption patterns change. This study explores the effects of projected national scale migration of populations from rural areas to urban areas and rapid demographic growth on energy consumption and, consequently, on natural resource pressure in Guatemala using an environmentally extended input-output approach
