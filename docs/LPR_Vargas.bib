	the traditional input-output model to account for the environmental
	impacts of production processes reveals the channels by which environmental
	burdens are transmitted throughout the economy. In particular, the
	environmental input-output approach is a useful technique for quantifying
	the changes in the levels of greenhouse emissions caused by changes
	in the final demand for production activities. The input-output model
	can also be used to determine the changes in the relative composition
	of greenhouse gas emissions due to exogenous inflows. In this paper
	we describe a method for evaluating how the exogenous changes in
	sectorial demand, such as changes in private consumption, public
	consumption, investment and exports, affect the relative contribution
	of the six major greenhouse gases regulated by the Kyoto Protocol
	to total greenhouse emissions. The empirical application is for Spain,
	and the economic and environmental data are for the year 2000. Our
	results show that there are significant differences in the effects
	of different sectors on the composition of greenhouse emissions.
	Therefore, the final impact on the relative contribution of pollutants
	will basically depend on the activity that receives the exogenous
	shock in final demand, because there are considerable differences
	in the way, and the extent to which, individual activities affect
	the relative composition of greenhouse gas emissions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {Abstract: In Korea, 97\% of the energy resources are imported. The
	growth rate of greenhouse gas {(GHG)} emission per capita in the
	country was the highest in the world during 1990 and 2004. Moreover,
	83\% of the domestic {GHG} emissions stemmed from energy use in the
	year 2004. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop an econometric
	model for energy intensity and {GHG} emission intensity in view of
	the poor energy endowment and environmental situation in Korea. In
	this study, a 96Ã—96 hybrid energy inputâ€“output {(E-IO)} table
	was constructed by using energy units for each energy sector from
	the 2000 Korean {IO} table developed by the Bank of Korea in 2003.
	By using this {E-IO} table, the amount of energy intensities and
	{GHG} emission intensities, caused by energy use, were estimated
	for each sector. It was revealed that in the case of direct energy
	use, the average values of the direct energy intensity and {GHG}
	emission intensity of 96 economic sectors were 0.186 ton of oil equivalent
	{(TOE)/million} Korean Won {(M-KRW)} and {0.315t-CO2-eq./M-KRW},
	respectively. Further, in the case of total energy use, the average
	values of the total or embodied energy intensity and {GHG} emission
	intensity of these sectors were estimated to be 0.640 {TOE/M-KRW}
	and {1.534t-CO2-eq./M-KRW}, respectively. From this integrated model,
	it is indicated that in order for Koreaâ€™s energy and environment
	countermeasure not to slow down the economic activity as well as
	achieve {GHG} reduction, the {GHG} emission and energy use characteristics
	of whole sectors must be taken into consideration simultaneously.

  abstract = {This paper presents a socio-economically disaggregated framework for
	attributing {CO2} emissions to people's high level functional needs.
	Based around a quasi-multi-regional inputâ€“output {(QMRIO)} model,
	the study, in theory, takes into account all {CO2} emissions that
	arise from energy used in production of goods and services to satisfy
	{UK} household demand, whether the emissions occur in the {UK} or
	abroad. Results show that {CO2} emissions attributable to households
	were 15\% above 1990 levels in 2004, and that although absolute decoupling
	occurred between household expenditure and {CO2} during the {UK's}
	switch from coal to gas in the early 1990s, since then only slight
	relative decoupling is evident. The proportion of {CO2} that arises
	outside {UK} borders in support of {UK} consumption is rising, and
	reducing these emissions is particularly problematic in a global
	trading system. Investigation into the carbon footprint of different
	segments of the {UK} population shows wide variation: the segment
	with the highest carbon footprint emits 64\% more {CO2} than the
	segment with the lowest. Results show that recreation and leisure
	are responsible for over one quarter of {CO2} emissions in a typical
	{UK} household in 2004. We conclude that expanding lifestyle aspirations
	are significant factors in driving household {CO2} emissions, but
	the study also emphasizes that attention must be paid to the infrastructures
	and institutions that result in considerable amounts of {CO2} being
	locked up in basic household activities through which people meet
	their everyday needs for subsistence, protection, and communication
	with family and friends. The findings highlight the sheer scale of
	the challenge facing {UK} policy-makers, and suggest that policies
	should be targeted towards segments of society responsible for the
	highest carbon footprints. {[Copyright} \&y\& Elsevier]},

	vast quantities of natural resources and leads to environmental stresses
	such as air and water pollution. Research into the metabolism of
	cities therefore aims at understanding the physical flows into, within,
	and out of cities with a view to reducing the use of resources and
	the environmental impacts. One important physical indicator is energy
	use. Most studies on cities only consider direct or end-user energy
	consumption. Since the function of cities is to serve the lives of
	their residents, indirect energy use in cities, or energy embodied
	in the consumption of goods and services by its residents, can be
	regarded as being as important as direct energy use. However, physical
	models of cities are extremely complex and have difficulty in dealing
	with boundary issues, and hence the indirect resource requirements.
	In this paper we use input-output analysis and detailed household
	expenditure data to yield comprehensive energy use breakdowns for
	the 14 Statistical Subdivisions of Sydney. Multivariate regression
	and structural path analysis {(SPA)} are used to interpret the results.
	Clear correlations can be drawn between energy use and income, household
	size, age, and degree of urbanity. The structural path analysis is
	used to demonstrate how significant differences in lifestyles between
	inner and outer areas of Sydney leads to different energy use characteristics.
	This final consumption-based approach to analysing the energy requirements
	for households has important implications for measures aimed at reducing
	energy use, which tend to only consider direct energy use.},

	uses an ecological-economic {Input-Output} model combining economic
	components valued in monetary terms with ecologic components - {GHG}
	emissions - expressed in physical terms. Economic and greenhouse
	gas emissions data for Canada are computed in the same sectoral disaggregation.
	Three policy scenarios are considered: the first one uses the direct
	emission coefficients to allocate the reduction in industrial output,
	while the other two use the direct plus indirect emission coefficients.
	In the first two scenarios, the reduction in industrial sector output
	is allocated uniformly across sectors while it is allocated to the
	12 largest emitting industries in the last one. The estimated impacts
	indicate that the results vary with the different allocation methods.
	The third policy scenario, allocation to the 12 largest emitting
	sectors, is the most cost effective of the three as the impacts of
	the Kyoto Protocol reduces Gross Domestic Product by 3.1\% compared
	to 24\% and 8.1\% in the first two scenarios. Computed economic costs
	should be considered as upper-bounds because the model assumes immediate
	adjustment to the Kyoto Protocol and because flexibility mechanisms
	are not incorporated. The resulting upper-bound impact of the third
	scenario may seem to contradict those who claim that the Kyoto Protocol

	possible to evaluate separately the effects of economic structure
	and pollution intensity captured by the environmental input-output
	model. Specifically, in this study, we distinguish between the effects
	on multipliers caused by changes in emission coefficients (the pollution
	intensity effects) and the effects on multipliers caused by changes
	in technical coefficients (the economic structure effects). Our results
	show a significant reduction in the pollution intensity of production
	activities, which contributed negatively to changes in emission multipliers.
	They also show that the economic structure contributed positively
	to changes in emission multipliers. Together, these two effects lead
	to a small reduction in multipliers during the period of analysis.
	My results also show significant differences in the individual behaviour
	of different sectors in terms of their contribution to multiplier
	changes. Since there are considerable differences in the way individual
	sectors affect the changes in emission levels, and in the intensity
	of these effects, this means that the final effects will basically
	depend on the activity considered.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

  abstract = {All goods and services produced in an economy are directly and/or
	indirectly associated with energy use and, according to the type
	of fuel utilized, with {CO2} emissions as well. International trade
	is an important factor in shaping the industrial structure of a country
	and, consequently, in affecting a country's energy use and {CO2}
	emissions. This study applies input-output techniques to the Brazilian
	economy to evaluate the total impacts of international trade on its
	energy use and {CO2} emissions. A commodity-by-industry {IO} model
	in hybrid units (energy commodities in physical units and non-energy
	commodities in monetary units) is applied to the Brazilian economy
	in 1995. Results show that total energy embodied in the exports of
	non-energy goods of Brazil equals 831 {PJ}, while total carbon embodied
	is 13.5 {MtC.} These amounts are larger than the relevant amounts
	embodied in the imports of non-energy goods, respectively 679 {PJ}
	and 9.9 {MtC.} These figures are better understood by contrasting
	them with the total energy use and the corresponding total carbon
	emissions of the Brazilian economy in 1995 estimated by this work:
	6781 {PJ} and 99.4 {MtC}, respectively. This means that international
	inflows and outflows of energy embodied in non-energy goods are in
	the order of 10 and 12\% of the total energy use, while inflows and
	outflows of carbon embodied in non-energy goods are approximately
	10 and 14\% of the corresponding total carbon emissions of the Brazilian
	economy in 1995. The general picture is that Brazil is not only a
	net exporter of energy (153 {PJ)} and of carbon (3.6 {MtC)} embodied
	in the non-energy goods internationally traded by the country in
	1995, but also that each dollar earned with exports embodied 40\%
	more energy and 56\% more carbon than each dollar spent on imports.
	These findings suggest that Brazilian policy-makers should be concerned
	about the extra impacts international trade policy may have on energy
	use and carbon emissions of the country.},
